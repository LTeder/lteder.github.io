introduction: |
  I'm a [young professional](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loganteder/) trying to lead into my next career move. Some things about me:
  
  - Employed at the medical device startup [Blinkcns](https://www.blinkcns.com/) (Charleston, SC) for over four years in various roles involving hardware engineering, programming, management, and design.
  - Lead inventor of *[Systems and methods for eyelid localization](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220383502A1/en)* and an inventor of *[A blink reflex monitoring device](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2022261316A1/en)*, both with Blinkcns.
  - Recent graduate from Columbia University with a BS in mechanical engineering.
  - Experienced (if not slightly amateur) [musician](https://soundcloud.com/loganted) and [actor](https://charlestonstage.com/helium-cast-2018) with a bit of formal training in each.
  
  Please reach out if you are hiring for engineering or people-oriented roles, or if you would like to collaborate on something. You'll find I'm an apt learner!
