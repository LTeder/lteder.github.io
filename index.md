introduction: |
  I'm a [young professional](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loganteder/) trying to lead into my next career move.
  Some things about me:
  
  - Employed at the medical device startup [Blinkcns](https://www.blinkcns.com/) (Charleston, SC) for over four years in various roles involving hardware engineering, programming, management, and design.
  - Lead inventor of *[Systems and methods for eyelid localization](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2022251703A2/en)* and *[Systems and methods for determining eye closure status](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2023154899A1/en)*, both with Blinkcns.
  - Recent graduate from Columbia University with a BS in Mechanical Engineering.
  - Experienced [musician](https://soundcloud.com/loganted) and [actor](https://charlestonstage.com/helium-cast-2018) with a bit of formal training in each.
  
  If you're hiring for engineering or people-oriented roles, or if you'd like to collaborate on a project, I'd love to hear from you. I'm a quick learner and always up for a new challenge!
